# 2.	Read in your file and Assign it to the name grecollege 
grecollege <- read.csv("grecollege.csv")

# 3.	Check the structure of the data using str
str(grecollege)

# 4.	Change admit into a factor using as.factor
grecollege$admit <- as.factor(grecollege$admit)

# 5.	Check the structure using str again and confirm it is a factor. 
str(grecollege)

# 6.	Index all columns
names(grecollege)

# 7.	Index the 40th row, first two columns
grecollege[40, 1:2]

# 8.	Use the R commands describe or glimpse to get descriptive statistics for all  variables, including mean, sd, var, and n’s.
describe(grecollege)

# 9.	Use describeBY to group by admit to get descriptive statistics.
describeBy(grecollege, group = grecollege$admit)

# 10.  Using counts and barplot create a barplot for gre and label axes.
gre_counts <- table(grecollege$gre)
barplot(gre_counts, xlab = "GRE Score", ylab = "Count")

# 11. Create histogram for GRE with main labels and axes labels
hist(grecollege$gre, main = "histogram of GRE Scores Distribution", xlab = "GRE Score", ylab = "Frequencey")

# 12.  Create a scatterplot for gre and gpa with main labels and axes. Change any of the options for colors, cex size, points, main and sub labels font sizes, bold, etc.
plot (grecollege$gre, grecollege$gpa, main = "Scatter Plot of GRE Scores perform GPA", xlab = "GRE Score", ylab = "GPA", col = "aquamarine2", cex = 0.8, pch = 16)

# 13. Use lm to get a linear model with gpa as the DV and gre as the IV
#a. Use Summary to get a print out of the lm  

lm_model <- lm(gpa ~ gre, data = grecollege)
summary(lm_model)

#b.  INTERPRET the coefficient and results.
# The Intercept is the baseline GPA when GRE equals to 0 is 2.6458978, and the Gre coefficient is small and significantly positive, as P <0.001. Their equation is GPA=0.0012660×GRE+2.6458978. However, since the R-squared is low, other factors should also be included in the model predicting GPA.
