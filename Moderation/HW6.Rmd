#9. Explain the results for the moderation

#Social Support was examined as a moderator of the relation between depression (DV) and stress (IV). Stress and social support were entered in the first step of the regression analysis. In the second step of the regression analysis, the interaction term between stress and social support was entered, and it explained a significant increase in variance in depression, R squared = .96, p < .001. Thus, social support was a significant moderator of the relationship between stress and depression. The unstandardized simple slope for individuals 1 SD below the mean of social support was .996, the unstandardized simple slope for individuals with a mean level of social support was -.10, and the unstandardized simple slope for individuals 1 SD above the mean of social support was -.1.196."
